## Usage

To use this application, the user must firstly create the database by using the terminal and navigating to the db directory. The user then must use the MYSQL shell to run "source schema.sql". Once the schema.sql file has been created. The user may optionally seed the database by navigating to the root folder and running "npm run seed". From there the user can start and manipulate server with "npm start". 

## Contributions

This application was developed from the starter code found at https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella. I also received help from tutor Katie Redford.
